# A Note on Labels and Cognitive Diversity

## Why Use These Terms

Throughout TIDE, I use terms like "neurotypical," "ASD," and "ADHD." I want to be clear about why I use these labels and what they mean in this context.

I don't believe in rigid diagnostic categories or that people fit neatly into boxes. Human cognition is beautifully diverse, dynamic, and exists on continuous spectrums rather than in discrete categories. The beauty of TIDE is that it demonstrates how different cognitive patterns are simply different solutions to the same fundamental challenges - not deficits or disorders.

## Labels as Communication Tools

I use these terms because:

1. **Common Understanding**: They provide a shared vocabulary that most people recognize, making the concepts more accessible
2. **Research Alignment**: My empirical work builds on existing neuroscience literature that uses these classifications
3. **Pattern Recognition**: They represent observable clusters of cognitive patterns, even if the boundaries are fuzzy
4. **Practical Application**: They help identify which cognitive strategies might work best for different individuals

## The TIDE Philosophy

TIDE itself embodies my belief that:

- Cognitive patterns are **dynamic**, not fixed
- Different patterns represent **different, valid ways** of processing information, given context
- Labels describe **tendencies**, not destinies
- Everyone uses different strategies in different contexts
- The goal is **understanding**, not categorization

## A Personal Note

As someone whose research emerged from studying these cognitive differences, I've seen firsthand how the traditional deficit-based model fails to capture the richness of human cognition. TIDE reframes these differences as architectural variations - like different operating systems that excel at different tasks.

When I say "ASD-TIDE," I'm not talking about a disorder. I'm talking about a systematic, pattern-based approach to cognition that happens to align with patterns often seen in autistic individuals. It's a cognitive style that our world desperately needs - imagine trying to build reliable systems without systematic thinkers!

## Moving Forward

My hope is that frameworks like TIDE can help us move beyond labels entirely, toward a more nuanced understanding of cognitive diversity. Until then, I'll continue using the vocabulary we have, while working toward a future where we can describe cognitive patterns without the baggage of pathology.

Remember: You are not your label. You are a dynamic, adaptive system capable of multiple cognitive strategies. TIDE is here to help us understand and leverage that diversity.
