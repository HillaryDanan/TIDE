# TIDE: Temporal-Internal Dimensional Encoding

> Part of the [Cognitive Architectures for AI](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/cognitive-architectures-ai) research program


A neuroscience-inspired framework for understanding cognitive architecture patterns through dimensional organization of self-representation and temporal processing.

## Overview

TIDE demonstrates how different cognitive systems achieve information integration through distinct dimensional arrangements, inspired by findings from autism research showing alternative neural pathways for abstract concept processing (Levinson, 2021).

## Key Insight

Different cognitive architectures represent valid solutions to the fundamental challenge of integrating self-representation with temporal processing:

- **NT-TIDE** (Neurotypical): Dynamic balance between internal self and external time
- **ASD-TIDE** (Autism): Systematic alignment with both self and time in external dimension  
- **ADHD-TIDE** (ADHD): Unified but unstable integration in internal dimension

## Installation

```bash
pip install tide-framework
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HillaryDanan/TIDE.git
cd TIDE
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
from tide import CognitiveArchitecture, DimensionalMapper

# Create architecture
nt_arch = CognitiveArchitecture('NT')
asd_arch = CognitiveArchitecture('ASD')

# Compare behavioral signatures
print(nt_arch.get_behavioral_signature())
print(asd_arch.get_behavioral_signature())

# Visualize dimensional mappings
mapper = DimensionalMapper()
fig = mapper.create_architecture_comparison()
fig.savefig('architecture_comparison.png')
```

## Applications

### 1. Cognitive Diversity in AI Systems
Different tasks benefit from different cognitive architectures:
- Systematic tasks ‚Üí ASD-TIDE architecture
- Adaptive tasks ‚Üí NT-TIDE architecture  
- Rapid response tasks ‚Üí ADHD-TIDE architecture

### 2. Interpretable AI Behavior
The dimensional framework provides interpretable explanations for AI system behavior based on their cognitive architecture configuration.

### 3. Robust System Design
Multiple architectures working together create more robust systems than monolithic approaches.

## Theoretical Foundation

Based on empirical findings from neuroscience research:
- Alternative neural pathways achieve identical outcomes (Levinson, 2021)
- Dimensional reorganization explains behavioral differences
- Builds on previous work: [BIND](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/BIND), [Concrete-Overflow](https://github.com/HillaryDanan/concrete-overflow-detector)

## Research Journey

This work represents the culmination of a research trajectory exploring information processing and cognitive architectures. See the [meta-repository overview](meta-repository.md) for the complete research journey from BIND through TIDE.


## Important Note on Terminology

I use diagnostic labels (NT, ASD, ADHD) throughout this framework as communication tools, not because I believe in rigid categorization. These terms represent observable patterns in cognitive organization, not fixed identities or disorders. See [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md) for my full thoughts on labels and cognitive diversity.

TIDE demonstrates that different cognitive patterns are simply different solutions to the same challenges - each with unique strengths. The framework itself embodies the dynamic, fluid nature of cognition (hence "TIDE" - patterns that ebb and flow).
